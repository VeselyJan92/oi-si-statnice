## Questions
Describe and compare the V and W models of the software testing process. Explain static testing and its role in the W model. Describe individual methods of static testing.

Explain the principle of Model Based Testing (MBT) and compare its advantages and disadvantages with manual testing approach. Give some examples of models that can be employed in MBT. How does MBT relate to test automation?

Outline the main test automation principle and economics. What are possible levels at which tests can be automated? Give some examples of main approaches and technologies that can be used in software test automation.

Explain the equivalence class and boundary values concepts and principle of the Combinatorial Interaction Testing. What is a combinatorial explosion effect, how to effectively reduce the input data combinations? Principle of pairwise (2-way) and N-way testing.

Principle of path-based testing. Formal definition of system model and test coverage criteria (node/edge coverage, edge-pair coverage, prime-path coverage). How prioritization of process/workflow activities is modelled and handled in the generation of the test cases?
